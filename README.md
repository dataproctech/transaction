Suppose that you are a manufacturer of product ABC, which is composed of parts A,
B, and C. Each time a new product ABC is created, it must be added to the product
inventory, using the PROD_QOH in a table named PRODUCT. Also, each time the
product is created, the parts inventory, using PART_QOH in a table named PART,
must be reduced by one each of parts A, B, and C. The sample database contents are
shown in Table P10.1.
